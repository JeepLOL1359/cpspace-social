      <h2>About CPSpace</h2>

        <p>
            CPSpace is a mental wellness web application designed to support young
            adults in understanding and managing their emotional well-being in a
            healthy, non-judgmental environment. The platform combines emotional
            self-reflection, anonymous social interaction, and AI-powered support
            to help users express their feelings safely and meaningfully.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike traditional mental health applications that focus heavily on
            clinical diagnosis or one-on-one therapy, CPSpace emphasizes daily
            emotional awareness and gradual self-improvement. By lowering the
            barriers to emotional expression, the system encourages users to
            reflect on their emotions, recognize recurring patterns, and develop
            healthier coping habits over time.
        </p>

      <h4>Project Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            The primary objective of CPSpace is to promote emotional self-awareness
            and psychological well-being among young adults through accessible and
            user-friendly digital tools. The platform aims to normalize emotional
            expression and reduce stigma by offering a safe space for reflection
            and support.
        </p>

        <p>
            CPSpace integrates personalization, data-driven insights, and
            responsible AI usage to provide tailored emotional guidance without
            replacing professional mental health care. By supporting reflection,
            coping strategy discovery, and emotional tracking, the system empowers
            users to take an active role in maintaining their mental wellness.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,
            particularly <strong>SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being)</strong> and
            <strong> SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions)</strong>, by
            promoting mental health awareness and fostering a respectful and
            supportive online community.
