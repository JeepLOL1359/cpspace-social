          This self-assessment consists of two short questionnaires, PHQ-9 and
          GAD-7, designed to help you reflect on your current mood and anxiety
          levels. The test usually takes 3–5 minutes to complete, and your
          responses will be kept private within CPSpace.
        </p>

        <p>
          This assessment is not a medical diagnosis, but it provides insight
          into your emotional well-being and helps us recommend suitable coping
          strategies for you.
